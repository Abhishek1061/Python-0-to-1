#In Python lists are the containers to store a set of values of any data type.
# Create a list uing []
a = [1,2,3,4,56,6]  # in this " a " is like an container which stores the values in itself (i.e [1,2,3,4,56,6])

# Print the list using print() function.

print(a)  

# Acess using index using a[0],a[1],a[2].

a[0] = 98 # this has simply replaced 1 by 98 as [0] tell the 1st charater in the code.
print(a)

# We can create a list with items of different types
c=[45,"harry", False,6.9]
print(c)

#list slicing
friends = ["harry","tom", "Rohan" , "sam", "Divya", 45]
print(friends[0:4]) # we have did slicing as we learned in chapter 3.
print(friends[-4:]) # another method of slicing.
